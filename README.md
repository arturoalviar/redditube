# redditube
Research project that takes youtube videos from r/videos and
tries to analyze the impact reddit has on youtube video views

## Requirements
- [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.org)
- Reddit Account

## Optional
- Youtube API Key (uncomment line 142 and comment line 143 to make script work without a API key although the functionality is not as great with out one)


## Usage
- Make sure the script is executable (use the command chomd +x redditube.py)
- After installing praw, you can run this
script using terminal by passing in
./redditube.py [keyword] where [keyword] is either
the word "hot" or "new".
